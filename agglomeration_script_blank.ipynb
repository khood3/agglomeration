    "# Problem Set 1: Empirical Problem - Estimating Agglomeration\n",
    "**Kyle Hood (JHU)**  \n",
    "**Fall, 2025**  \n",
    "\n",
    "This problem explores the results reported by Ahlfeldt et al. in Sections 5.2 and 5.3.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "The data used in this problem are available in the file `berlin_36_86.parquet`. This file contains the data frame that we will be working with.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables in the Data Frame\n",
    "- **block_id**: An ID variable for each block  \n",
    "- **area_id**: An ID variable for each district  \n",
    "- **dummywest**: A dummy variable indicating West Berlin (1) or East Berlin (0)  \n",
    "- **d_wall**: The distance to the inner Berlin Wall (in km)  \n",
    "- **d_outb**: The distance to the outer wall separating West Berlin from the rest of East Germany (in km)  \n",
    "- **d_cbd**: The distance to the central business district  \n",
    "- **floor_1936**: The relative price of floor space in 1936  \n",
    "- **floor_1986**: The relative price of floor space in 1986  \n",
    "- **emp_wpl_1936**: Workplace employment in 1936  \n",
    "- **emp_wpl_1986**: Workplace employment in 1986  \n",
    "- **emp_rsd_1936**: Residents employment in 1936  \n",
    "- **emp_rsd_1986**: Residents employment in 1986  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "- Several questions focus on West Berlin data. You can subset the data using Python's `pandas` library.\n",
    "- Growth in a price or quantity is typically expressed as a **log difference**:\n",
    "  - **Correct**: \\( \\Delta \\log x_t = \\log x_t - \\log x_{t-1} \\)\n",
    "  - **Incorrect**: \\( \\Delta \\log x_t \\neq \\log(x_t - x_{t-1}) \\)\n",
    "- When computing growth rates, omit observations where the value in one of the years is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1: Understanding the Data [2 points]\n",
    "### 1a: Focus on West Berlin data  \n",
    "- Did the price of floor space become more or less dispersed between 1936 and 1986 in West Berlin?  \n",
    "- What led you to this conclusion?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1b: Compare East and West Berlin  \n",
    "- On average, was East or West Berlin more densely populated in 1936?  \n",
    "- What led you to this conclusion?  \n",
    "  *Note*: Assume all blocks are of equal area, and the employment-to-population ratio is the same for each block.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2a: Plots  \n",
    "- Using Python's `matplotlib` or `seaborn` libraries, plot the log difference in the price of floor space and the difference in workplace employment between 1936 and 1986 in West Berlin against the distance from the inner Berlin Wall.  \n",
    "  - Distance to the wall should be on the horizontal axis.  \n",
    "  - Submit these plots with the problem set.  \n",
    "- Are there relationships between the pairs of variables that each plot represents?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2: Estimation [4 points]\n",
    "This question is based on Section 5.2 of Ahlfeldt et al. All calculations are done only with West Berlin data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2a: Regressions  \n",
    "1. **Regression 1**:  \n",
    "   - Regress log differences in floor prices (1936â€“1986) on distance from CBD.  \n",
    "   - Answer the following:\n",
    "     - What is the estimated slope coefficient?  \n",
    "     - How is this coefficient interpreted?  \n",
    "     - Why is it important to look at (log) differences in prices rather than price levels or log-levels?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Regression 2**:  \n",
    "   - Regress the log difference in floor price on distance from CBD and a dummy variable for each district.  \n",
    "     *Hint*: Use Python's `statsmodels` library to create dummies:  \n",
    "     - What happened to the coefficient on distance from CBD compared to Regression 1?  \n",
    "     - What is the interpretation of the difference in coefficients?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Regression 3**:  \n",
    "   - Regress the log difference in floor price on distance from CBD, a dummy variable for each district, and the distance from the inner and outer walls.  \n",
    "     - What happened to the coefficient on distance from CBD compared to Regression 2?  \n",
    "     - Why would the researcher wish to add distance from inner and outer walls to the regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Regression 4**:  \n",
    "   - Compute an indicator variable for the six grid cells as defined in the paper.  \n",
    "   - Repeat the regressions in Regression 1 and Regression 3, replacing distance from CBD with the six-grid-cell indicator.  \n",
    "     *Hint*: Use Python's `pandas` library or create six separate variables.  \n",
    "     - Can you see a pattern of lower prices near the pre-war CBD in the indicator variable coefficients?  \n",
    "     - Did this pattern change much when you added the additional covariates?  \n",
    "     - Is there a good reason to use the grid cell version instead of the linear specification?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3: Comparison to Paper [2 points]\n",
    "1. How do the regression specifications you ran differ from the regressions in columns (1) to (3) of Table 1 in the paper?  \n",
    "2. Why did the authors estimate the regressions how they did?  \n",
    "   - Compare columns (1) and (3) of Table 1 using the plot from Question 1.  \n",
    "3. Consider land prices in the first grid cell from the Berlin Wall (0.75 km from the wall).  \n",
    "   - What is the prediction of the model in the paper (using column (1)) on the percent change in land prices?  \n",
    "     *Hint*: Look for the answer in the paper."
